# skabuffersim

To build you need to have the syDEVS build tree in the directory one level below the directory that the skabuffersim files are in and will need to have built at least the statick syDEVS library.

Currently this only has a simple Makefile in the src directory. Therefore, after buidying syDEVS run make in the src directory. This will create an skabuffer executable in the src directory.
